    *geopy
      *Used for finding distances using longitudes and latitudes 
*amCharts

# Base Objectives 

*There are three graphs near the bottom of my webpage
  *A bar graph of price vs Neighborhood
  *A bar graph of ratings vs Neighborhood
  *A pie graph of the types of listings
*Given a location I am able to calculate the potential earnings
  *A number of days that the location will be listed is asked to improve accuracy
  *The price per day is used by taking an average of other listings in a radius around the given location
*Given a location I am able to calculate the potential earnings
  *it is calculated by using the price of the listing in a radius around the location with the most listings
